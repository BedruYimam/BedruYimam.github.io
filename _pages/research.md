# Research Overview

My research focuses on applying computational methods to address challenges in education, language processing, and development.

## Current Projects

### 1. **Educational Data Mining for Ethiopian Universities**
*Funding: Ethiopian Ministry of Education (2022-2025)*  
Developing machine learning models to predict student dropout, identify at-risk students, and improve retention rates in Ethiopian higher education institutions.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Early warning system for student performance
- Personalized learning pathway recommendations
- Data dashboard for university administrators

**Team:** 3 PhD students, 2 MSc students  
**Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, Django, PostgreSQL

### 2. **NLP for Low-Resource Languages**
*Collaboration: Pan-African NLP Initiative*  
Building natural language processing tools and resources for Amharic and other Ethiopian languages.

**Components:**
- Amharic text corpus development
- Pretrained language models
- Named entity recognition system
- Machine translation prototypes

### 3. **Open Science Infrastructure**
Creating open-source tools and workflows to support reproducible research in African institutions.

## Past Projects

### **Data Science for Public Health** (2020-2022)
Developed predictive models for disease outbreak monitoring in collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute.

### **Educational Technology Platform** (2019-2021)
Led development of a mobile learning platform for rural schools, reaching 5,000+ students.

## Research Collaborations

- **Addis Ababa University AI Lab**
- **African Institute for Mathematical Sciences**
- **Ethiopian Artificial Intelligence Association**
- **Multiple international universities**

## Funding & Grants

1. **Early Career Research Grant**  
   *Ethiopian Science Foundation* | 2023-2025 | $50,000

2. **Digital Education Innovation Award**  
   *Mastercard Foundation* | 2022-2024 | $75,000

3. **Open Science Infrastructure Grant**
